# Mitron-Credit-Card-Analysis

## Project Description

**Digits and Dreams Analytics** has the opportunity to collaborate with **Mitron Bank**, a legacy financial institution based in Mumbai. Mitron Bank plans to launch a new line of credit cards to expand its financial footprint and diversify its product offerings. 

To evaluate this potential partnership, Mitron Bank provided a sample dataset of 4,000 customers across five cities. This dataset contains detailed information about customer spending and financial behavior.

As the lead data analyst for this pilot project, my goal is to analyze the data and generate actionable insights to help Mitron Bank tailor their new credit card offerings to meet customer needs and market trends. The successful outcome of this project will play a critical role in securing the full partnership.
